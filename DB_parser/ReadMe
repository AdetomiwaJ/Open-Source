There are two scripts in this project
- big_db_script.py: created by ChatGPT
    This script will create a sample database with dummy data for you to play around with, feel free to edit.

- DB_csvparser.py: created by me :D
    This simple script parses through a .db file and produces .csv files.
    It creates a .csv file per table in the database.
